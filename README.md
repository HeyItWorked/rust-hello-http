A RESTful CRUD API for managing a Pok√©mon team, built with Rust and Axum. This project demonstrates core concepts of web development in Rust including async/await, shared state management, and REST API design.

**Note:** This is an educational project designed to showcase Rust web development fundamentals.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, and Delete Pok√©mon
- **RESTful API Design** - Follows REST conventions with proper HTTP methods and status codes
- **Thread-Safe State Management** - Uses `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for concurrent access
- **Type-Safe JSON Handling** - Leverages Serde for serialization/deserialization
- **In-Memory Storage** - Simple Vec-based storage (no database required)

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70 or higher ([Install Rust](https://rustup.rs/))

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-hello-http.git
cd rust-hello-http

# Build and run
cargo run
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

## üì° API Endpoints

### Create a Pok√©mon
```bash
POST /pokemon
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Pikachu",
  "poke_type": "Electric",
  "level": 25
}

# Response: 201 Created
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Pikachu",
  "poke_type": "Electric",
  "level": 25
}
```

### Get All Pok√©mon
```bash
GET /pokemon

# Response: 200 OK
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Pikachu",
    "poke_type": "Electric",
    "level": 25
  }
]
```

### Get Pok√©mon by ID
```bash
GET /pokemon/{id}

# Response: 200 OK (if found)
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Pikachu",
  "poke_type": "Electric",
  "level": 25
}

# Response: 404 Not Found (if not found)
```

### Update a Pok√©mon
```bash
PUT /pokemon/{id}
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "level": 30
}

# Response: 200 OK
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Pikachu",
  "poke_type": "Electric",
  "level": 30
}

# Note: All fields are optional for partial updates
```

### Delete a Pok√©mon
```bash
DELETE /pokemon/{id}

# Response: 204 No Content (if deleted)
# Response: 404 Not Found (if not found)
```

## üß™ Testing the API

### Using cURL

```bash
# Create a Pok√©mon
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/pokemon \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Pikachu","poke_type":"Electric","level":25}'

# Get all Pok√©mon
curl http://localhost:3000/pokemon

# Get one Pok√©mon
curl http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1

# Update a Pok√©mon
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"level":30}'

# Delete a Pok√©mon
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1
```

### Using Postman

Import these endpoints into Postman:

| Method | URL | Body |
|--------|-----|------|
| POST | `http://localhost:3000/pokemon` | `{"name":"Pikachu","poke_type":"Electric","level":25}` |
| GET | `http://localhost:3000/pokemon` | - |
| GET | `http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1` | - |
| PUT | `http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1` | `{"level":30}` |
| DELETE | `http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1` | - |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Stack

- **[Axum 0.8](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum)** - Web framework
- **[Tokio](https://tokio.rs/)** - Async runtime
- **[Serde](https://serde.rs/)** - JSON serialization/deserialization
- **Rust Standard Library** - `Arc<Mutex<T>>` for shared state

### Key Design Patterns

- **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)** - Separate structs for create/update operations
- **Shared State** - `Arc<Mutex<Vec<Pokemon>>>` for thread-safe concurrent access
- **Extractors** - Type-safe parameter extraction (`State`, `Json`, `Path`)
- **Result Types** - Proper error handling with `Result<T, E>`

---

## üéì What This Project Demonstrates

### Rust Concepts
- Ownership and borrowing
- `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>` types
- Pattern matching (`if let`, `match`)
- Closures and iterators
- Shared state with `Arc<Mutex<T>>`

### Web Development
- RESTful API design
- HTTP methods and status codes
- JSON serialization/deserialization
- Request/response handling
- Path parameters

### Axum Framework
- Router configuration
- Handler functions
- Extractors (`State`, `Json`, `Path`)
- Shared application state

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use
```bash
# Find and kill the process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000
kill -9 <PID>

# Or change the port in main.rs
```

### Data Disappears on Restart
This is expected behavior. The API uses in-memory storage. Data is lost when the server stops. For persistence, consider adding a database or file-based storage.

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add input validation
- [ ] Implement error response with JSON
- [ ] Add persistence (database or file storage)
- [ ] Add search/filter endpoints
- [ ] Add pagination for large datasets
- [ ] Add tests (unit and integration)
- [ ] Add logging middleware
- [ ] Add CORS support
